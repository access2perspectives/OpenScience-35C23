# #OpenScience at #35C3
https://events.ccc.de/congress/2018/wiki/index.php/Session:Open_science

Co-writing a proceedings of our meetup

Find the initial brainstorming at https://board.net/p/35C3_OpenScience


## Next steps from here
- use the #OpenScience liberally
- follow @OpenScienceMOOC 
- commit to co-writing a proceedings paper 

After several #35C3 sessions on #OpenScience and related topics we want to get together to get to know each other and discuss further. 

### list of relevant #35C3 sessions
- … (keyote Claudia Frick)
- … (predatory journals, Julia Jerke)
- FOSS Asia
- critical making in Academia (Regina Sipos & Saad Chinoy)


Why is Open Science not already happening as the default?

In less than 60 minutes, 21 ppl discussed a range of topics relating and rotating around #OpenScience, #OpenAccess and #OpenScienceHardware. The outcomes will be captured, further elaborated upon and published #openaccess.

## Methodology 
(suggestions, feel free to add alternatives)
- add not more than 3 arguments per person pro and/or against each of the following + reference if applicable
- collaboratively write on Github.com
- publish at Zenodo.org // #35C3 proceedings




## What’s #kaputt and how to fix/hack it


### Paywalls
Multiple payed process (scientists, editors, journal fees)
Journal Packages without any need for the most of them - higher costs for science


### Scientists are living in a bubble
'In my lab I'm the only one interested in open access." 

Concerned individuals isolated in the lab

missing interlinks of state of the art in different communities, how to find the findings in other areas

Communities don't have to overlap - new informations / resources are not shared by default, especially when they're not open
- quality measures: impact factor / h-factor etc.
- funding mechanis

What to do about senior researchers who are in charge?
Stop the "passing on" of (bad) traditions: People targeting at high ranked journals trying to get a bigger impact - and ruining it all


- Science needs to be better explained to the public --> more public science communication

ComicBook Format is super effective for storytelling, need more science centric good content like "Super Science Friends" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Science_Friends or like PhD Comics 

The Adventures of Shewy the Electric Microbe: https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.teachersource.com/downloads/lesson_pdf/Shewy_the_Electric_Microbe.pdf



## How can we hack OpenScience?
(congress perspective)
- organize meetups locally 
- Reputation by editorship (run your own academic journal)

Join Open Science Barcamp 2019, in Berlin March 18 - https://www.open-science-conference.eu/barcamp/

Organize an Open Science BarCamp at your institute

Join / kickoff local Open Science meetups! Look for People from library and other sectors to help you with this!



### Fakescience 
- http://www.dhmo.org/truth/Dihydrogen-Monoxide.html


### Open Data


### predatoryjournals 
we should probably abandon the hashtag #fakescience in the context of predatory journals because it gives the impression that those journals however are some form of science


### Open Access
Are preprint repositories a sustainable approach for #OpenAccess?
How can junior researchers be motivated to publish open access? Peer pressure, Prof pressure, etc.  

Publishing as HTML on the Web and respond to the [Call for Linked Research](https://linkedresearch.org/calls#call-for-linked-research) > indexible by search engines, discuss about the paper in the paper, annotate the paper

Examples: http://csarven.ca/enabling-accessible-knowledge and http://csarven.ca/this-paper-is-a-demo

Funding requests for OA publications by library not each individual scientist (administrative work)

What is holding back "platinum OA"?
Wrong incentives for junior researchers, the conventional system (paywall, publish or perish etc.) does not value open science and communication between scientists

Crowdfund the buyout of Copyright - e.g. www.unglue.it (for books) and www.unpaywall.org (for research articles)

Publish Papers open access
 



### OpenSource4Science
https://waag.org/en/open-wetlab-faq

Open Source Medicine

use free and open-source hard- and software to bypass copyright issues

### Open Educational Resources (OER)
- SlideWiki (http://slidewiki.org/, http://slidewiki.eu)


### DecolonizingScience
- How colonial is the global research landscape (still) today?

Amano T, González-Varo JP, Sutherland WJ (2016) Languages Are Still a Major Barrier to Global Science. PLoS Biol 14(12): e2000933. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.2000933

Preprint repository for African research output: AfricArXiv http://africarxiv.org/


### ScienceEvaluation
ImpactFactor (using them as quality indicator for one publication and the journal, adding them up, ...)
H-Index

Counting number of publications and citations

Funding based on publications

Missing method for quality evaluation (only quantitative)


### PublishOrPerish or #PublishandFlourish ?
- https://twitter.com/hashtag/publishandflourish


### Infrastructure
Publishing infrastructure in commercial hands / not in the hands of science

Universities are organized federated in themselves, faculties and research groups are in some kind autonomous, so we need some system that can be installed/setup at any level to federate the research findings and aggregate them on any level (university, faculty, institute, researchgroup/lab, researcher)

Monopolies like Google Scholar, WoS - decentralized alternatives

Pressure to publish, lack of awareness re differences between fields

Who owns critical research infrastructure, e.g. systems of reseacher evaluation?

Commercial entities (publishers) dictating research flows
Missing reliable/standardized research information systems 

We have to use central services to get our scores and publications lists

Job offering for professorships shouldn't aks for journal indicators, but instead for open practices / experiences


#### Funding & Finances
How to do science and get funding without beeing attached to established research institutions

Where does the money come from?

Pay for permissions to re-use material

Transparency of public spending could be a lever

Scientists not getting paid for some of their work (peer review, admin, …)

using Patreon as a "pay as you like" subscription model to incentivise the adoption and use of CreativeCommons licensed publication


#### Quality assurance
Evaluation based solely / mainly on traditional publications; there are other products / activities

Journal indicators, h-index, Impact factor, etc.


#### Legal Issues
Being lost in legal issues, as a researcher / librarian 

Copyright issues

Data security

Data privacy

Libraries cannot take the risk of publicly archiving free available content - there are no fair use licenses in Germany!

[Reiss-Engelhorn-Museum law case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reiss_Engelhorn_Museum)

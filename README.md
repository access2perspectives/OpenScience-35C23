# OpenScience-35C3
Co-writing a proceedings of our #OpenScience Meetup at #35C3


Find the initial brainstorming at https://board.net/p/35C3_OpenScience

Open Science at #35C3
https://events.ccc.de/congress/2018/wiki/index.php/Session:Open_science
>> We can co-write a proceedings paper at https://github.com/access2perspectives/OpenScience-35C3 (feel free to suggest alternatives)

Next steps from here
use the #OpenScience liberally
follow @OpenScienceMOOC ‏
 

After several #35C3 sessions on #OpenScience and related topics we want to get together to get to know each other and discuss further. 
We will discuss in a very concise way a range of topics relating and rotating around #OpenScience, #OpenAccess and #OpenScienceHardware. The outcomes will be captured, further elaborated upon and published #openaccess.

Methodology (suggestions, feel free to add alternatives)
- add not more than 3 arguments per person pro and/or against each of the following + reference if applicable
- collaboratively write on Github.com
- publish at Zenodo.org // #35C3 proceedings

Key questions
Are preprint repositories a sustainable approach for #OpenAccess?
How colonial is the global research landscape (still) today?

What’s #kaputt? and how to fix/hack it.
- Paywalls
Multiple payed process (scientists, editors, journal fees)
Journal Packages without any need for the most of them - higher costs for science
- we are living in a bubble
'In my lab I'm the only one interested in open access." 
Being isolated in the lab
missing interlinks of state of the art in different communities, how to find the findings in other areas
Communities don't have to overlap - new informations / resources are not shared by default, especially when they're not open
- quality measures: impact factor / h-factor etc.
- funding mechanis
Transparency of public spending could be a lever
Where does the money come from?
Funding requests for OA publications by library not each individual scientist (administrative work)
What is holding back "platinum OA"?
- wrong incentives for junior researchers, the conventional system (paywall, publish or perish etc.) does not value open science and communication between scientists
Evaluation based solely / mainly on traditional publications; there are other products / activities
What to do about senior researchers who are in charge?
Stop the "passing on" of (bad, unscientific) traditions
People are targeting at high ranked journals trying to get a bigger impact - and ruining it all ;-)
using patreon as a "pay as you like" subscription model to incentivise the adoption and use of CreativeCommons licensed publication
- commercial entities dictating research flows

- infrastructure
Centralization
- research informationsystems 

- we have to use central services to get our scores and publications lists

- Science needs to be explained to the public --> open up also for science communication
ComicBook Format is super effective for storytelling, need more science centric good content like "Super Science Friends" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Science_Friends or like PhD Comics 
The Adventures of Shewy the Electric Microbe: https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.teachersource.com/downloads/lesson_pdf/Shewy_the_Electric_Microbe.pdf

Politics don't care - we should make it political
Copyright issues
Libraries cannot take the risk of publicly archiving free available content -there are no fair use licenses in Germany!
Pay for permissions to re-use material
Let's hack this! 
Publish Papers open access. 
Crowdfund the buyout of Copyright - e.g. "www.unglue.it"
use free and open-source hard- and software to pass copyright issues
Job offering for professorships shouldn't aks for journal indicators, but instead for open practices / experiences
Join / kickoff local Open Science meetups! Look for People from library and other sectors to help you with this!
Join Open Science Barcamp 2019, in Berlin March 18 - https://www.open-science-conference.eu/barcamp/
When 
Get more hands to do so! Organize BarCamps on your own.

How can we hack OpenScience?
(congress perspective)
organize meetups locally 
Reputation by editorship (run your own academic journal)


Favorite / main topics mentioned at introduction round
Decolonization of science and research
Open Hardware
How to do science and get funding without beeing attached to established research institutions
Scientists not getting paid for some of their work
Open Source Medicine
Open Access
Who owns critical research infrastructure, e.g. systems of reseacher evaluation?
Journal indicators, h-index etc.
Being lost in legal issues, as a researcher / librarian 
Monopolies like Google Scholar, WoS - decentralized alternatives
Open Educational Resources
Why is Open Science not already happening (as the default)?
Reiss-Engelhorn-Museum law case
Pressure to publish, lack of awareness re differences between fields
Microbial Fuel Cells: electricity from mud-microbes.
DIY Fermentation: gut microbes to instil cultural inteaction

#OpenData

#predatoryjournals 
we should probably abandon the hashtag #fakescience in the context of predatory journals because it gives the impression that those journals however are some form of science

#OpenAccess
how can junior researchers be motivated to publish open access? Peer pressure, Prof pressure, etc. / They want, they 
#HowToHack?: Publishing as HTML on the Web and answer to the linked research call (https://linkedresearch.org/) -> indexible by search engines, discuss about the paper in the paper, annotate the paper

#ScienceEvaluation

ImpactFactor (using them as quality indicator for one publication and the journal, adding them up, ...)
H-Index
Counting number of publications and citations
Funding based on publications
Missing method for quality evaluation (only quantitative)

#PublishOrPerish or #PublishandFlourish ?
- https://twitter.com/hashtag/publishandflourish

#Infrastructure

Publishing infrastructure in commercial hands / not in the hands of science
Universities are organized federated in them selves, faculties and research groups are in some kind autonomous, so we need some system that can be installed/setup at any level to federate the research findings and aggregate them on any level (levels: university, faculty, institute, researchgroup/lab, researcher)
